# ***Liqube Dark Code Theme*** for VSCode

# Introduction

A fresh and stylish **dark theme** for *Visual Studio Code*, designed to be **less colorful**, **less distracting**, but **much more focused** than other themes.
While specifically created for **evening/night coding** the color scheme also works fine for day-time work.

This theme was made with C, C++, PHP, HTML, CSS, and LUA in mind, but should work fine for most languages.
